# Chef Examples

As a Customer Archtect (CA) at Chef, it's my goal to keep this repo updated with
examples of good patterns that I've seen work with many customers. The idea is
to have a complete working example of a Chef ecosystem, that utilizes all of the 
many components that make up Chef's software base. This includes:

*  Chef Server
    * [Role Cookbook model](./role_cookbook_model.md)
    * Chef-Repo pipeline using Jenkins
    * Chef Cookbook pipeline using Jenkins
    * [Chef Cookbook Pipeline using Azure DevOps](./azure-devops-pipeline-walkthrough.md)
    * Push Jobs
    * Enabling Habitat 
*  Chef Automate
    * [Setting up SAML Auth in A2 with Okta](./a2-saml-with-okta.md)
    * Chef Cookbook pipeline using Workflow
    * Example deployment in AWS, Azure and Google w/Autoscaling Worker Nodes
*  Habitat
    * A full example of a working Habitat app
    * How to use Chef to deploy Habitat
    
I'll be adding to this repo as I learn and grow in my role @Chef, so please
follow this repo as it will be updated often and frequently.
